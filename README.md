here we must to use double power supplies, one is "5.4v" and another one is "5.0v"

# Description

some transistors used in this big project, some of them are for the fast blinker, and some of them is for the Arduino systems

used to be the knowledge of transistor systems, Seems complex but it's actually easy, just like switch but it's more electronic

Here the materials :
- Breadboard x4
- Arduino Nano x1
- LED pin x55
- Resistor 220Ω x13
- Resistor 1000Ω x1
- Resistor 1000000Ω x1
- Transistor NPN x6
- Transistor PNP x1
- Passive Buzzer x1
- Switch SPST x2
- Push Button x2
- Power Supply x2
